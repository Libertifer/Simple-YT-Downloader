# Simple YT Downloader
did your mom ever ask you to download a video or music from YouTube for her? Probably yes, several times, that's why i created this simple program, literally the simplest thing ever, both in terms of usage and code, i hope this is useful for you (you probably want it for your mom too)


## usage
1. the program by default attempts to select the downloads folder as the save directory, if you want to change it, there is a ðŸ“‚ button, click it, and choose another directory

2. choose between video (mp4) or audio (mp3), once done, paste the link into the text field and click the download ðŸ“¥ buttonm that's it, the download will begin

3. that's all, does it sound complicated? perhaps, but when you open the program, you'll realize that there's really nothing simpler than this, enjoy!
## licence
idk dude, i used python, pytube and ffmpeg, idk what licence they have and if they say that "i must use the same licence", do wharever you want i guess and respect those licence, maybe ffmpeg licence since im distributing ffmpeg.exe? whatever, links so maybe I won't get in trouble
